# ðŸ’» DSA-Practice

This repository contains all my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice questions and solutions.

I'm following **Love Babbar's DSA Playlist**, and the folder structure is organized according to the lecture numbers from the playlist. For example:

## ðŸš€ Goal

To build a solid foundation in DSA for interviews, competitive programming, and technical placements by solving a structured set of problems.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
- `L3` â†’ Lecture 3
- `L10` â†’ Lecture 10
- Custom folders (with unique names) â†’ My own additions beyond the playlist.
- and so on...

In addition to the playlist-based practice, Iâ€™ve also included some **original problem sets and practice folders**, which are marked with custom names.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered ( which i plan to ) 
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Hashing

> ðŸŽ¯ Consistency is key! Iâ€™ll keep updating this repository as I make progress through the playlist and add more problems of my own.
